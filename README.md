# ep_bva
Choose one of the exercises seen in class for the EP & BVA techniques. In different files, implement the funcion and the tests you planned. KEEP THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FUNCTION AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE TESTS SEPARATELY. 
Upload the following documents:
   1) Code with the implementation of the funcion described in the exercise. Any programming language will do.
   2) Code with the implementation of the tests. This code should call/import/use the function implemented in 1), and it should generate 3).
   3) Report with the resulting table: text document produced by executing 2).
   
   EXAMPLE
   
   1) Implementation of the function
   
   LIBRARY.H

   bool my_function(float v) {
   
     // Function implementation
     
   }
   
   2) Implementation of the tests
   
   TESTS.CPP

   #include <iostream>
   
   #include "library.h"
   int main() {
   
   // Test cases for EP calling the function in the library
   
   // Test cases for BVA calling the function in the library
   
   // Generate report to observe the outcome of the test cases
   
   }
  
   3) Report with the resulting table 
   
   REPORT.TXT
   
 
   Test data | Expected result | Actual result | Pass/Fail
   
   ...
